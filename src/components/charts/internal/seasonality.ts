/**
 * Aggregates `data` into an average seasonal path across its own historical years — pure,
 * independent of any rendering: takes candles and a config, returns numbers. Each included year
 * is one "occurrence": rebased to a % change from its own first available close (so years at very
 * different price levels still compare on equal footing, same rebasing idea `CandlestickChart`'s
 * own symbol-overlay comparison uses), then read off at each bucket's own last available close
 * within it — except "day", read off at each bucket's own trading-day *ordinal* within that year
 * instead (see the main loop below for why: a calendar day-of-year offset lands on a different
 * weekday every year, so on any given calendar-day bucket only *some* years have an actual
 * trading session there, and which ones rotates from one calendar day to the next. Averaging
 * whichever years happen to have data at each individual calendar offset — instead of comparing
 * the same years' Nth trading day to each other — silently swapped in and out very differently-
 * positioned years bucket to bucket, producing sharp, meaningless day-to-day swings with no real
 * seasonal signal behind them). `average` is the plain mean of every year's own value at that
 * bucket — see
 * `SeasonalityOccurrence`'s doc comment for how future features (dispersion bands, individual
 * occurrences, weighted averages, automatic filters) are meant to build on the same `occurrences`
 * array instead of changing this traversal.
 *
 * `buckets[0]` (the earliest real bucket some year actually has data for) is *not* necessarily
 * every included year's own 0% starting point — it's already that year's cumulative change by the
 * end of that bucket, which is rarely exactly 0. Without an explicit anchor, every line would
 * appear to "start" wherever its own first real bucket already happens to be (visibly already up
 * or down), with no shared reference the way every year trivially shares one at its own true
 * start. A synthetic bucket at index -1 is prepended for that: every year that contributed at
 * least one real occurrence gets an entry there too, always exactly 0 by construction (it *is*
 * each year's own reference point, divided by itself) — so every line visibly starts from the same
 * shared (-1, 0%) anchor before diverging into its own real buckets. Skipped for "year"
 * granularity, whose single real bucket is meant to read as one summary number, not a line.
